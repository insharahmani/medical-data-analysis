Medical Dataset Analysis: Python, SQL, and Insights

A comprehensive healthcare data analysis project focusing on hospitalization details, medical examinations, and patient profiles. Using **Python**, **SQL**, and **Power BI**, this project uncovers hidden trends, identifies cost factors, and provides actionable insights for improving healthcare decision-making.

Project Overview

This project explores three interconnected datasets:

- `hospitalization_details`
- `medical_examinations`
- `names`

By cleaning, joining, and analyzing these datasets, we offer a 360° view of patient health metrics, hospital charges, and health trends across various demographics and city tiers.

Tools & Technologies

- **Python (Pandas)** – Data preprocessing, cleaning, and transformation  
- **SQL (16 complex queries)** – Analytical insights from structured data  
- **Power BI** – Interactive dashboard for visual storytelling  
- **Excel** – For quick cross-verification and exploratory analysis  

---

Project Goals

- Derive actionable insights from medical and hospitalization data  
- Identify patterns in healthcare costs and patient health conditions  
- Analyze the influence of variables like BMI, smoking, city tier, and hospital tier  
- Visualize findings in an interactive, decision-friendly format  

---

Key Findings

✅ High charges are linked to **major surgeries**, **transplants**, and **specific medical conditions**  
✅ Significant **variation in charges** across **hospital tiers** and **city tiers**  
✅ **Higher BMI** often correlates with increased healthcare costs  
✅ Temporal trends reveal **fluctuations in hospitalization charges** year-over-year

Challenges Faced

- Handling nulls, inconsistencies, and duplicates in large datasets  
- Complex joins across 3 relational datasets  
- Maintaining data integrity during transformation  
- Building scalable queries for insights across time, tiers, and conditions

Analytical Results (16 SQL Queries)

1. Average Hospital Charges: $13,564.60  
2. Customers with charges > $700  
3. Patients with BMI > 35 and their charges  
4. Patients with major surgeries  
5. Avg charges by hospital tier (2000)  
6. Smoking patients who had transplants  
7. Customers with surgery or cancer history  
8. Customer with the most major surgeries  
9. Major surgeries categorized by city tier  
10. Avg BMI by city tier in 1995  
11. High BMI patients with additional health issues  
12. Top-charged patient and their city tier per year  
13. Top 3 customers by average yearly charges  
14. Total charge rankings by customer  
15. Year with peak hospitalizations
16. Comprehensive Year-wise Trends



Conclusion

This project showcases how combining **Python, SQL, and Data Visualization** can lead to powerful healthcare insights:

- Deep understanding of cost drivers like BMI, surgery, and lifestyle habits  
- Strategic recommendations for healthcare resource allocation  
- Framework for patient risk profiling using data  

By turning raw data into insights, this project reflects the **transformative power of data-driven decision-making in the medical field.**
